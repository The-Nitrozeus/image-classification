## 🚀 Project Overview

This is a self-developed project focused on building an AI-based image classification system using Python and deep learning. The aim is to classify different animal species from a set of labeled images. This solution can be extended to real-time applications like wildlife monitoring, educational tools, and mobile apps for animal recognition.

A dataset of 320 labeled animal images was used to train and evaluate the model.

## 🧠 Key Objectives

- ✅ Load and preprocess a custom image dataset  
- ✅ Train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for multi-class classification  
- ✅ Predict animal types in unseen images using the trained model

## 🐶 Sample Dataset Images

The dataset includes images of multiple animal categories, such as:

- 🦡 Badger  
- 🐕 Dog  
- 🐱 Cat  
- 🦌 Antelope  

*Images were visualized within the notebook to verify correct loading and classification.*
